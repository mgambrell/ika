# ika 2020

Updates for 2020, building in windows
* Only Debug|Win32 configuration works.
* Put the python31_d.dll i've given you in ika/engine/Debug (later I will fix this, I didn't want to commit big WIP dlls)


# ika

ika is a game engine I worked on between 2001 and 2007 or so.  It uses SDL and OpenGL for graphics and Python for
scripting.

It is hosted here primarily for archival purposes.

I think it was pretty cool in its day.
